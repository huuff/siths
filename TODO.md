# Tasks
## Ops
* Use SLF4J to do some debug logging
* Setup CircleCI to publish to maven central 
* Set `codecov.io`

## Jedis tools
* Maybe a builder for a jedis pool

## Siths
* Distributed data structures that implement their respective Kotlin interfaces such as `MutableList`, `MutableMap`, `MutableSet`, etc.
* As a follow up to the previous one (a different kind of data structure) distributed hash-map that takes a key prefix (i.e. such as `cache`) and implements `MutableMap`, operating on all elements `cache:«key»`
* Test with some huge key or value
* Test my transaction code with the locking examples of "Redis in Action"
