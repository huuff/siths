# Tasks
## Ops
* Use SLF4J to do some debug logging
* Setup CircleCI to publish to maven central 
* Set `codecov.io`

## Siths
* Implement `PERSIST`
* Implement `EXPIREAT`
* Implement `ZSET` operations! I had forgotten
* Implement a distributed counter!
* Before implementing the `MutableList`, implement ALL list commands
* Distributed data structures that implement their respective Kotlin interfaces such as `MutableList`, `MutableMap`,  etc.
* Test with some huge key or value
* Implement the Redis in Action semaphore
* What if I simplify complex operations such as those of `SithsSet` or `SithsList` by making them lua scripts?
